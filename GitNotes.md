## Key Features of GitHub

### 1. **Repositories**
- A repository is a storage space where your project files, including code, documentation, and other assets, are kept.
- Repositories can be **public** or **private**.

### 2. **Branches**
- Branches allow you to work on different versions of a project simultaneously.
- The default branch is typically named `main`.
- Developers often create new branches for features or bug fixes and later merge them into the main branch.

### 3. **Commits**
- Commits are snapshots of your project at a specific point in time.
- Each commit includes a message describing the changes made.

### 4. **Pull Requests**
- A pull request allows you to propose changes to a repository.
- Collaborators can review, discuss, and approve changes before merging them into the main branch.

### 5. **Issues**
- Issues are used to track bugs, enhancements, or tasks.
- They facilitate communication and organization within the development team.

### 6. **Actions**
- GitHub Actions allow automation of workflows like testing, building, and deploying code.
